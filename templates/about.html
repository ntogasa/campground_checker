            <p>Campground Scavenger is here to make your life easier.
                <br><br>
                Everyone loves a nice campground, and so reserving them can get pretty competitive. And if you've
                ever tried to reserve a campsite online, chances are you've used 'recreation.gov' to do so.
                <br><br>
                The problem with <a href="https://www.recreation.gov">recreation.gov</a>'s
                campground availability interface is that you have to check
                the campgrounds individually. This means that if you want to know if ANY campsites are available
                in Yosemite National Park, you need to visit the web page of each campsite to find out.
                <br><br>
                Campground Scavenger on the other hand, lets you enter in as many campgrounds as you want, and tells
                you whether any of them are available. So you can search all your targets at once.
                <br><br>
                The limiting factor here is the campsite IDs. This application requires that you input the 6 digit
                campground ID numbers for the campgrounds you want to check. What I have done is collect some of
                these IDs and
                <ol>
                    <li>put them on the 'List' page</li>
                    <li>group them together, so you can search a whole park/forest/zone at once</li>
                </ol>
                Anyways, I hope this makes it easier for you go plan your next outdoor excursion. Enjoy!
