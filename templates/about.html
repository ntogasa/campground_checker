                Campground Scavenger is here to make it easier for you to find campground availabilities.
                <br><br>
                If you've reserved a campground online before, chances are you've used recreation.gov to do so.
                A huge inefficiency (that I believe is intentional design) of recreation.gov's reservation
                interface tis that you can only check one campground at a time for availabilities.
                <br><br>
                This means that if you want to know if ANY campsites are available
                in Yosemite National Park, you need to visit the web page of each campsite to find out.
                <br><br>
                Campground Scavenger on the other hand, let's you mass search as many campgrounds as you want. At
                the click of a button, you can search every reservable campground in Kings Canyon National Park!
                <br>
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center">How to use</h5>
            <ol class="text-left">
                <li>go to <a href="{% url 'campgrounds' %}">Campgrounds</a> and search your desired parent zone (i.e. Kings Canyon National Park)</li>
                <li>copy the ID numbers, and go to the <a href="{% url 'availability' %}">Availability</a> page</li>
                <li>paste them in the input field, along with your target dates, and submit</li>
                <li>wait for your results to appear!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I hope this makes it easier for you to plan your next outdoor excursion. Enjoy!</p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="text-center">API</h5>
            <p>You can visit the API to access our campground database. Each campground object in the database
            includes a name, ID number, and parent zone name.</p>
